    <h2><u>Welcome to CharitAble India!</u></h2> <br>
    <p> Like the world-changers who support our organization, we are focused on making a long-term
      impact by helping kids living in poverty. We have a bold vision: graduating healthy, educated,
      empowered and employed young adults from our program so they can achieve the goal of breaking the cycle of poverty.<br>
      <p> And not just that, we also intend to act against the problems which stem like
        branches out of the root of poverty and strangle the childhood of the underpriviledged.
        To know more about the organisation, visit <a href="{% url 'about' %}">About</a>. <br>
      Below listed are the demons we intend to fight and win against: </p>
    </p>
  </div> <br><br>

  <div class="flex-parent">
    <div class="Introduction">
    <h3> Poverty </h3>
    <p> Low income, debt and poor quality housing put children’s mental health at risk. But there is a widespread
      lack of recognition about the impact that living in poverty can have on children’s mental health and well-being.
    They also lack a proactive support system. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="Introduction">
      <h3> Child Labour </h3>
      <p> Despite decades of social reforms, Child labour still flourishes in our cities and villages.
        Caught between the planes of India’s poverty prism, kids who are already far removed from an inadequate educational system,
        get further caught in the grips of child labour.   </p>
    </div>

      <div class="Introduction">
        <h3> Child Refugee Crisis </h3>
        <p> Nearly half of all refugees are children, and almost one in three children living outside
          their country of birth is a refugee. They are exposed to disease outbreaks,
          long-term psychological trauma, inadequate access to water and sanitation, nutritious food and education.  </p>
      </div>
  </div> <br>

    <div class="flex-parent">
      <div class="Introduction">
        <h3> Child Trafficking </h3>
        <p> Poor and marginalized children are often forced into labour or begging rackets or even prostitution
          in case of girls and are destined for a life of child abuse and exploitation.
          Presently, the count of total missing children stands astonishingly high.  </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Introduction">
        <h3> Improper Healthcare </h3>
        <p> Inadequate access to healthy food, proper hygiene, healthcare services and safe drinking water
          causes malnutrition in children. Undernutrition at an early age has serious effects on the physical
          and mental development of children.  </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Introduction">
        <h3> Lack of Education </h3>
        <p>  Lack of education has serious effects on children. They have trouble getting ahead in life
          and experience: poor health, lack of a voice, shorter lifespan, unemployment, exploitation and gender inequality.
          This deprives them of good career opportunities and a balanced life. </p>
      </div>
    </div> <br><br>

  <div class="intro">
    <p> Our fight against these demonic setups around children of India and the entire world might seem difficult at times.
      But we pledge to work tirelessly in favour of the children of India and the entire
      world as they are the ones who will lead us into the future and moreover no child deserves to be treated any less.
      No dose of discouragement can overwhelm our mindset of <em>'together we can'</em>.
      You can support us and the cause by donating or contributing in any way possible. <br> Let us make this world a better place for children. </p>
